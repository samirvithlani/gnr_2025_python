take monthly sal from user: 10000:
find PA sal : 10000* 12 -->
if pa salary >=20 lack tax  20%

if pa salary >5 lack tax  5%
if pa salary <=5 lack no tax


after tax sal > 10 lacks user is elligible for home loan

string: "char" 

array: array is collection similar data types
"char"
string: 
1)string stores collection of char
2)string is immutable
3)string is a class
4)string is a data type 'str'
5)string stores data in index manner
6)string is iterable
7)string is subscriptable

mutable and immutable:
data = "abc"
a = 0
b = 1
c = 2

data[0] = "A" modify
